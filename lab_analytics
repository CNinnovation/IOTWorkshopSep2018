# Lab Analytics

Azure Stream Analytics

## Preparation

Download the [sample sensor data](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/azure-stream-analytics/master/Samples/GettingStarted/HelloWorldASA-InputStream.json).

Create a blob object in Azure Storage and upload the sensor data.

## Stream Analytics

Create a stream analytics job with 1 streaming unit and the *cloud* hosting environment.

Add the blob storage to the input of the analytics job.

Set a new blob storage to the output

Configure this transformation query. Rename the output and input accordingly.

```SQL
SELECT 
System.Timestamp AS OutputTime,
dspl AS SensorName,
Avg(temp) AS AvgTemperature
INTO
  BlobOutput
FROM
  BlobInput TIMESTAMP BY time
GROUP BY TumblingWindow(second,30),dspl
HAVING Avg(temp)>100
```

Accept late arriving events to 20 days (configure event ordering)

Start the stream analytics job (see overview for the start button).
